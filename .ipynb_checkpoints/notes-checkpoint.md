- Coffee is one of the most popular plants in the world.
- It takes about 3-4 years to grow before producing berries, which we use to brew coffee, one of the most popular drinks.
- Coffee berries are picked, washed, pulped, dried, and roasted to make coffee.
- Coffee is everywhere, and the world consumes about 500 billion cups of it every year.
- ! how much coffee we consume -- **data** -
- ! where do coffee grows, major coffee producers -- **data** -
- But, there's a crisis on the horizon.
- Coffee doesn't grow anywhere.
- ! coffee producing, quantity -- **data** -
- About 15 years ago, production fell enormously, and with every year is even worse.
- ! coffee prices -- **data** -
- There're a wide variety of coffee plants, few are farmed, most of them are wild. Two of the most popular cultivated coffee plants are robusta and arabica.
- ! How much robusta and arabica coffee we produced -- **data** ?
- Robusta is more hardy, but it carries the more traditional bitter taste and high acidity.
- Arabica is the good and fancy stuff, it has a smooth and mild taste and is used for high-quality coffee.
- Both species require specific conditions to grow, but arabica is particularly more sensitive. The plant needs temperatures between 18-21°C. It also needs a specific amount of rain, preferably with a 3 month dry season to flower. And curcially, it needs warm days and cool nights, so it grows best at a certain elevation. Altogether, that means Arabica grows best between these latitudes: 25°N - 30°S.
- If you were to create a perfect place for coffee, it would look a lot like Colombia. Colombian coffee is cultivated by hand, and because of that it is considered the best in the world.
- But, climate change and global warming slowly changes the Colombian region.
- ! Climate change data in Colombia -- **data** -
- That resulted in that pushing the optimal elevation for coffee higher up the mountain, from 1000-2000m to higher.
- The warmer climate is also ideal for pests and fungi.
- ! pests and fungis that can attack coffee plants -- **data** ?
- Since 2013, the amount of land used to grow coffee in Colombia has fallen by more than 7%.
- The zona cafetera is projected to warm by .3 degress per decade and see more extreme weather.
- ! weather projections in colombia -- **data** - 
- A recent study estimates that by 2050 the amount of land that can sustain coffee cultivation will be reduce by 50%.
- Another study estimates that 60% of wild coffee species could be at the risk of extinction because of climate change.
- That's not only bad news for the plant, but also for those who have relied on the coffee industry for generations.
- ! GDP data for Colombia by industry -- **data** - 
- In the early 20th century, Americans and Europeans were buying more and more coffee.
- So prices were high and that created a boom in coffee producing countries.
- ! Price of coffee cents per kilogram -- **data** - 
- In 1929, the US economy crashed, demand for coffee plummeted and so did the price bankrupting the plantations.
- That is when the government stepped in, they purchased the large coffee fields from the owners, many had more than a thousand hectares, and broke them up into smaller plots of about 16 hectares each, before selling them to laborers.
- The idea was that these smaller farms would grow other crops along with coffee to sustain themselves through price fluctuations.
- To support the new small farms, the government had created Fedecafe, an agency that would organize and represent the farmers, by negotiating fair prices and favorable deals with other countries.
- The most important one was in 1962, when Colombia signed the International Coffee Agreement with 69 other countries, and set a price minimum for export.
- ! International Coffee Agreement exporting and importing countries -- **data** - 
- There are several ways farmers can protect their coffee plants from the effects of climate change.
- Shade trees keep the plants cool and stabilize the soil. They can move their crops uphill, where it's cooler. They can also switch to more resistant varieties of coffee plants.
- In the 1980s, the coffee agreement fell apart along with the price minimum. Since then, more countries, especially some in Asia, have increasingly flooded the market with cheap coffee.
- It sparked a crisis around 2009, when extreme weather and coffee rust decimated Colombia's crop.
- ! Colombia's annual coffee production -- **data**
- For farmers it's hard to adapt to climate change, because without another international agreement setting a new price minimum, thus providing reasonable profit for farmers, is no longer possible.
- ! Price of coffee, per thousand COP/125kg bag -- **data**
- But, it's not just a problem for Colombian people, 80% of the world's coffee is grown by 25 million smalholder farmers, many are living in poverty.
