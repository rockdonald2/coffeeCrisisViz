                    world. It takes about 3-4 years to grow before producing berries, which we use to brew coffee, one of the
                    most popular drinks in the modern era.

                    Coffee berries are picked, washed, pulped, dried, and roasted to make coffee, and the world consumes about
                    500 billion cups of it every year. <span class="emphasize">But, there's a crisis on the horizon</span>, mainly
                    because coffee doesn't
                    grow anywhere, but it's needed everywhere.

                    About 15 years ago, production fell enormously, and with each consecutive year things are even worse. There're
                    a wide variety of coffee plants, few are farmed, most of them are wild. Two of the most popular cultivated
                    coffee plants are <span class="emphasize">Robusta</span> and <span class="emphasize">Arabica</span>.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph--text">
                    Robusta is more hardy, but it carries the more traditional bitter taste and high acidity. Arabica is the good
                    and fancy stuff, it has a smooth and mild taste, and is used for high-quality coffee. Most of the fast-coffee
                    we drink in cafeterias are made of the last one.

                <p class="paragraph--text">
                    Nowadays, as climate changes and the prices get lower, native coffee growers are afraid that the coffee
                    cultural landscape in coffee growing countries will be just a memory.
